Networks of recombinant antigen genes from the human malaria parasite P. falciparum. Each of the 9 networks shares the same set of vertices but has different edges, corresponding to the 9 highly variable regions (HVRs) in the DBLa domain of the var protein. Nodes are var genes, and two genes are connected if they share a substring whose length is statistically significant. Metadata includes two types of node labels, both based on sequence structure around HVR6.

Networks of carbon exchanges among species in the cypress wetlands of South Florida. One network covers the wet and the other the dry season. Each node represents a taxon (similar to a species), and a directed edge indicates that one taxon uses another as food.
